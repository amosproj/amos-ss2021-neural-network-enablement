**Industry Partner** 
Heiko Schick, Huawei Germany

**Project Description**
The goal of the project is to transfer existing neural networks onto Huawei provided hardware (Atlas 200 DK System) and software and to turn the use of those neural networks into a (web service mediated) service.

    The service shall: 
    ● Allow the upload and display of input and output images
    ● The application of the neural network to the images
    
    The neural networks:
    ● Have to be transferred, configured, and possibly trained
    ● Onto dedicated hardware attached to a student workstation
    
The main function of the nueral network allows for colorization of black & white images, but other functions might be added.   

**Project Constraints**
Core technologies: Python, Python frameworks, and Linux
Team language: English
Needed resources: The Atlas 200DK System
